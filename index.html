  The coronavirus outbreak has totally altered our relationship with work. 
<br>
  
  Next, it may totally put an end to work for millions of Americans whose jobs are especially at risk of automation, which is set to spike -- alongside job loss -- as a result of the pandemic. 
 
  <br>

  “We are already seeing today an uptick in business orders for some robotic equipment,” said Gregory DeFreitas, a labor studies expert and professor of economics at Hofstra University. 

  <br>
  
  “So long as we need social distancing, this is likely to continue, especially at the chains and giant corporations most likely to survive the 2020 recession,” he added. 

<br>
  
  “These crises,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, in an interview with Vox, “have historically inordinately been visited on workers whose work actually was automatable.” 

<br>
  
  
  Muro forecasted a wave of automation-linked job loss in these occupations as a result of the country’s economic slowdown, ominously citing a recent study that found 88% percent of jobs lost during the last three recessions “took place in routine highly automatable occupations.” 

  <br>
  
  The occupations most susceptible to automation, Muro said, include: food service, administrative/clerical work, bookkeeping, computer programming, financial analysis, retail, construction, transportation/warehouse jobs and -- last but not least -- manufacturing/production. 

  <br>

  To make matters worse, a BLS projection of employment between 2014 to 2024 predicted that many of these jobs are already projected to fade away due to technological innovation.

 <p>
   
   Manufacturing, an industry popularly thought to already be highly automated, remains at risk, Muro told Vox.
   
   <br>

   In fact, 10 of the top 25 US metro areas with the largest share of high-risk jobs belong to the midwest, or the industrial “Rust Belt,” the HQ of American manufacturing.

   <p>
  
  This threat of automation poses not only financial concerns for millions of Americans, but also a political one, going forward.
