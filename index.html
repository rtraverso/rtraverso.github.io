The coronavirus outbreak has totally altered our relationship with work. 
  
Next, it may totally put an end to work for millions of Americans whose jobs are especially at risk of automation, which is set to spike -- alongside job loss -- as a result of the pandemic. 
  
“We are already seeing today an uptick in business orders for some robotic equipment,” said Gregory DeFreitas, a labor studies expert and professor of economics at Hofstra University. 
“So long as we need social distancing, this is likely to continue, especially at the chains and giant corporations most likely to survive the 2020 recession,” he added. 

“These crises,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, in an interview with Vox, “have historically inordinately been visited on workers whose work actually was automatable.” 

Muro forecasted a wave of automation-linked job loss in these occupations as a result of the country’s economic slowdown, ominously citing a recent study that found 88% percent of jobs lost during the last three recessions “took place in routine highly automatable occupations.” 
The occupations most susceptible to automation, Muro said, include: food service, administrative/clerical work, bookkeeping, computer programming, financial analysis, retail, construction, transportation/warehouse jobs and -- last but not least -- manufacturing/production. 

To make matters worse, a BLS projection of employment between 2014 to 2024 predicted that many of these jobs are already projected to fade away due to technological innovation.
