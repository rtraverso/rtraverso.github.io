  The coronavirus outbreak has totally altered our relationship with work. 
<br>
    
    <br>
  
  Next, it may totally put an end to work for Americans whose jobs are vulnerable to automation, which is set to spike -- alongside job loss -- as a result of the pandemic. 
 
  <br>
  
  <br>

  “We are already seeing today an uptick in business orders for some robotic equipment,” said Gregory DeFreitas, a labor studies expert and professor of economics at Hofstra University. 

  <br>
    
    <br>
  
  “So long as we need social distancing, this is likely to continue, especially at the chains and giant corporations most likely to survive the 2020 recession,” he added.

    <h2> Certain jobs at higher risk of automation </h2>
    
    
    <br>
        
         “These crises,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, in an interview with <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/31/21200010/coronavirus-recession-automation-brookings-mark-muro">Vox,</a> “have historically inordinately been visited on workers whose work actually was automatable.” 
  
        <br>
        
        <br>
  
  He forecasted a wave of automation-linked job loss in these occupations as a result of the country’s economic slowdown, ominously citing a recent study that found 88% percent of jobs lost during the last three recessions “took place in routine highly automatable occupations.” 

  <br>
    
    <br>
  
  The occupations most susceptible to automation, Muro said, include: food service, administrative/clerical work, bookkeeping, computer programming, financial analysis, retail, construction, transportation/warehouse jobs and -- last but not least -- manufacturing/production. 

  <br>
    
    <br>

  To make matters worse, a <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/pdf/occupational-employment-projections-to-2024.pdf">BLS projection</a> of employment between 2014 to 2024 predicted that many of these jobs are already projected to fade away due to technological innovation.

   <h2> Manufacturing remains vulnerable </h2>
  
  <br>

      <font size="+2">
  
   Manufacturing, an industry popularly thought to already be highly automated, remains at risk, Muro told Vox.
   
   <br>
   
   <br>

   In fact, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/automation-and-artificial-intelligence-how-machines-affect-people-and-places/">10 of the top 25 US metro areas</a> with the largest share of high-risk jobs belong to the midwest, or the industrial “Rust Belt,” the HQ of American manufacturing. 

 
  <br>
   
   <br>
  
 Further automation in the manufacturing industry would be disastrous for millions of Americans and could drive a potential <a href="https://www.axios.com/robots-automation-populist-uprising-2016-presidential-election-45400a64-9ee3-4a46-b473-ab822429631b.html">political</a> crisis, too.
